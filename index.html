        <h1>About</h1>
        <p>
            Everyone knows that through consistency, people can improve their skills and work. That's the idea of A Thing A Week! A Thing A Week is a community of designers and developers focused on creating awesome products weekly. We are an inclusive community where people can increase their skills! The idea is to provide valuable feedback to members of the community.</p>
        <br>
        <br>
        <h1>How It Works</h1>
        <p>At the beginning of the week on Sunday night, a message is sent out to the entire group on what the theme for the week. From that point, you can start to build your awesome product, whether it is a design project, or development project! You have until Friday night to finish it, and then submit it! You can submit your project at <a href="http://show.athingaweek.com">show.athingaweek.com</a>.
            <br>
            <br>Once you submit it, we then review your submission. Once we review your submission, you can view your submission at <a href="http://show.athingaweek.com">show.athingweek.com</a>.
